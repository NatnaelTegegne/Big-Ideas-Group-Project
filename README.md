ðŸ§  Simple Greeting Program

This is a simple Python program that asks the user for their name and age, then responds with a friendly message. It also tells the user how old theyâ€™ll be next year and ends with a cheerful note.

ðŸ’» How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter their name.

It then asks for their age (as a number).

Finally, it prints:

A greeting with the userâ€™s name and age.

A fun fact about how old theyâ€™ll be next year.
